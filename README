Make your photo look like Obama's famous poster.

Usage:

  ./obamafy.py original_photo [obamafied_photo]

To adjust the way resulting colors are combined fine-tune the following
parameters:

  --posterization [default = 3]   shrink number of bits per color to this value
  --median        [default = 5]   radius of median filter

To change the way color values are chosen use these parameters:

  --dark-blue [default = 20] percent of picture to be colored with dark blue
  --red       [default = 30] percent of picture to be colored with red

Have fun!
